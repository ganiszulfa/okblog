## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. Build for production:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

## Authentication

The admin interface uses JWT token-based authentication. The current implementation includes a simple mock authentication for development purposes. In a production environment, this should be connected to a proper authentication service.

Default development credentials:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `password`

## API Connection

The application connects to the backend API through a proxy configuration in the Vite setup. The default configuration assumes the API is running at `http://localhost:8080`.

You can modify the API endpoint in the `vite.config.js` file if needed.
